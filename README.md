# NightPI
Based on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Kali Linux installed, the "NightPi" is a briefcase that has been specially designed to learn and perform penetration testing, investigation (OSINT) and radio.
This repository contain all usefull explanation about how to make one, so don't hesitate to build for yourself this usefull tool and improve it :D
# Features
In order to be rapidly deployable, some features has been added :
- Offline database with documentation of many programs (created with HTTrack)
- High security browser (protection against fingerprint + TOR proxy)
- Extra open-source tools installed (OSINT, SDR, etc)
# Hardware
Here is a example of the hardware that I've used. Feel free to choose them according to your specific needs (dimension, more powerfull equipment...):

| **Raspberry Pi 3B+** | **64GB SD Card** | **Wired keyboard** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **External Hard Drive** | **Portable screen** | **RFID RC 522** |
| **RTL-SDR** | **USB/Jack cable** | **Wireless module** |
| **Powered USB hub** | **Fans** | **Battery** |

**Cost estimated :** around 500 $

But the most important piece is probably the briefcase itself :) Depending on the style/quality/size that you want, it will impact how you'll have to build it and the dimension of the components that you choose).

# Further improvements
- [ ] More powerfull computer (Raspberry Pi alternative ?)
- [ ] Better range for WIFI and radio
- [ ] Full-disk encryption
