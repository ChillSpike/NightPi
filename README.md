# NightPI
An all-in-one briefcase for pentesting, OSINT and radio exploitation

Based on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Kali Linux installed, the "NightPi" is a briefcase that has been specially designed to learn and perform penetration testing, investigation (OSINT) and radio.
This repository contain all usefull explanation about how to make one, so don't hesitate to build for yourself this usefull tool and improve it :D
# Features
In order to be rapidly deployable, some features has been added :
- Offline database with documentation of many programs (created with HTTrack)
- High security browser (protection against fingerprint + TOR proxy)
- Extra open-source tools installed (OSINT, SDR, etc)
# Hardware
This is a example of the hardware that I've used. Feel free to change them according to your specific needs (dimension, more powerfull equipment...):

| **Raspberry Pi 3B+** | **64GB SD Card** |
| --- | --- |
| **Wired keyboard** | **External Hard Drive** |
| **Portable screen** | **RFID RC 522** |
| **RTL-SDR** | **USB/Jack cable** |
| **Wireless module** | **Fans** |
| **Powered USB hub** | **Battery** |
* Raspberry Pi 3B+ with 64Gb card
* Wired keyboard (ex: Perixx PERIBOARD-319)
* Portable screen (ex: Koolertron 11.6" HDMI 1080P IPS)
* An RTL-SDR (ex: NooElec NESDR Smart Bundle)
* Wireless module (ex: ALFA Network AWUS036NHA, compatible with packet injection)
* Powered USB hub (ex: TP-Link UH700)
* An RFID RC 522
* External Hard drive
* USB and jack cable (Once you'll finish to build this project, your Raspberry will be less accessible, that's why it's important to build an extension that can be accessed outside).
* Fans (plug-in on the GPIO and/or on a USB for example)
* Battery

Cost estimated : around 500 $

But the most important piece is probably the briefcase itself :) Depending on the style/quality/size that you want, it will impact how you'll have to build it and the dimension of the components that you choose).
